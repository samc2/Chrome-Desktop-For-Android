How to install the ‘desktop’ version of Chrome for Android and use Chrome extensions

1) Click this link to open Google’s download page for the “desktop” builds of Chrome for Android.

2) Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the folder containing the latest build (the one with the highest number).

3) Open that folder and download the “chrome-android-desktop.zip” file.

4) Extract the .zip file and locate “ChromePublic.apk” inside the chrome-android-desktop > apks.

5) Tap the ChromePublic.apk file to install it using Android’s Package Installer.

6) Launch the new Chromium app from your app drawer. (Note: Because this is built from Chrome’s open-source code, it will appear as “Chromium,” not “Chrome.”)

7) Navigate to the Chrome Web Store and install your favorite Chrome extensions. (Note: If you are on a phone, the Chrome Web Store won’t let you install extensions directly. A workaround is to enable Developer Options, find the “Smallest Width” option, and change it to “600.” This will make Chrome think your device is a desktop, which should allow you to install extensions directly from the Chrome Web Store.)

And that’s it! The process is much simpler than before. However, before you start browsing, there are a few important caveats to keep in mind:

Missing Features: Because these builds are compiled from Chromium, the open-source version of Chrome, they lack proprietary Google features like account sync and Google Cast support.

No Automatic Updates: Since this app is not installed from the Google Play Store, you will need to manually check for and install new versions.

Potential for Bugs: These are experimental builds that have not undergone extensive testing. They can be buggy, so we don’t recommend relying on them for any critical tasks.
